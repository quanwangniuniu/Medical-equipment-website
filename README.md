### Project Background
The project was originaly designed for my mom's business website where all the employees can have a convinent way to clock in and aquire for any vacation leaves.
However, after finishing the work, the project was rejected to put on a DNS server because of its high expenditure against to the initial budget.
Then, our team put this project on my own Ali Cloud for study use rather than business usage. 
The project worked smoothly untill the private server hit the deadline.
